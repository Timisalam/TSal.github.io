	<p class = "secondary"><em>Winning sixth man of the year award</em>  </p>
  <br>
  <p class = "Accolades">Though Tyler has only been in the league 4 years, he has broken plenty of records for the Miami Heat, such as being the first player in Miami Heat history to have 30 points and 10 rebounds off the bench, as well as being the only player in NBA history to make at least nine three-pointers in two games on consecutive days. He is the third player ever to make at least nine threes in back-to-back games, joining Stephen Curry and James Harden. He has also tied the Heat record for most threes in a game with 10.
    <br>
    <br>
    He was selected second team all-rookie and last season was awarded the Sixth Man of the year award whilst averaging 20.7 points, 5 rebounds and 4 assists per game while shooting 40% from three. He has had a promising start to his career which has led to him signing a $130 million 4 year deal with Miami in the summer.
